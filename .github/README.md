## This is a fork of [Gerg-L](https://github.com/Gerg-L)'s [Spicetify-Nix](https://github.com/Gerg-L/spicetify-nix) with many more extensions, some more customapps and a handful of themes. There's no guarantee that every theme, customapp or extension works correctly, but they should at least not throw errors while running nixos-rebuild etc.
